# Variational Auto Encoder
## About this Project
Please see my [post](https://yukunchen113.github.io/project/2019/03/03/Variational-Autoencoder.html) on my website about the analysis for the theory behind VAEs, and my analysis on the models

## Requirements
Please pull my utils_tf1 repo, and add it to your python path (rename it to utils). The functions there are used.

The model is contained in main.py, the parameters are in params.py and the predictions folder contains saved images during training.
